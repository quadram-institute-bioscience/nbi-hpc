## Why an HPC?

This training assumes you are already familiar with using the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI).

So why using an HPC instead of a single machine (that can be your local computer, a physical server or a Virtual Machine)?

## What we will do

1. We will learn how to use the NBI HPC and to submit jobs with the appropriate resources
2. We will install micromamba to manage our own packages
3. We will understand what Singularity containers are, and how to use existing singularity packages
4. We will see how to create our own Singularity containers to ensure reproducibility of our pipelines
